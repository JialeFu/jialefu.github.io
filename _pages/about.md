# About Me
I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in *Artificial Intelligence* at PALM lab, Southeast University, under the guidance of Professor Xu Yang. Prior to this, I completed my Bachelor's degree in *Mathematics and Applied Mathematics* at the same institution. My research interests primarily focus on parallel inference, with an emphasis on speculative ensemble methods, as well as reasoning within large language models.
