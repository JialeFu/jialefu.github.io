# About Me
I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence at [PALM](https://palm.seu.edu.cn/home.html) lab, Southeast University, under the guidance of Professor [Xu Yang](https://yangxuntu.github.io/). Prior to this, I completed my Bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics at the same institution. My research interests primarily focus on parallel inference, with an emphasis on speculative ensemble methods, as well as reasoning within large language models.
